Android Application signing
=====================================

Application Example: Set up a signature using *Java Key Store (JKS)*.

## Java Key Store
You can create your JKS or use a key generated by another company as a security requirement. You will need the alias and password to access the file.

#### SigningConfigs

- **storeFile:** File storage path of your Java Key Store.
- **storePassword:** Password of your JKS.
- **keyAlias:** Name of the internal key.
- **keyPassword:** Internal key password.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Important:** Do not place the .JKS file within the application resources. Just reference the local file.

```java
android {
    ...
    signingConfigs {
        yourKey {
            storeFile file("C:/.../your_JKS.jks")
            storePassword "password"
            keyAlias "alias"
            keyPassword "password"
        }
    }
   ...
}
```
#### BuildTypes | BuildVariant
Reference the key you created earlier in Android Build Variants.

```java
android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
        release {
          ...
         signingConfig signingConfigs.yourKey
        }
        debug {
          ...
         signingConfig signingConfigs.yourKey
         debuggable true
        }
    }
 }
```

After the modifications will be necessary to synchronize the project with the *IDE* for the operation of this property. 
In some cases it becomes necessary to clean up the project cache and to verify in which build varients the project is being compiled.
